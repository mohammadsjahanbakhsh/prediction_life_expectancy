ML(python)

    Working on the life expectancy data published by the United Nations and adding several regular features from different datasets
    Preprocessing and dealing with missing data filling them with possible values
    With the decision tree regression model, using the relevant data from 2015 to 2021 and my own features that were predicted by the R2 square above 0.8, I chose the model and predicted for 2022.
    Then, with several different models, I predicted the life expectancy index for 2022 and evaluated it with the values published by the United Nations using the R2 square measure.

BI ( power BI)  

    The questions that were defined for the project have been illustrated and dashboarded using the Power BI tool
